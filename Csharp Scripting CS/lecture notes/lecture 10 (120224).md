unity has a dedicated light2d component for 2d light objects. 
- sprite lights behave like shining a flashlight through a cutout (aka a cookie). 
- freeform lights allow you to construct a polygon in the editor which represents the area on which the light shines
- global lights let you change the overall intensity/colour filter applied over the whole scene
- spot lights are just a circular area of illumination which lets you control how sharp the falloff is. you can also do arcs instead of full circles

light blending modes
- additive - light colour is added onto the existing colour of materials
- multiplicative - light colour is multiplied with existing materials

2d shadows work differently to 3d ones, you need to specify exactly which lights cast and which objects produce shadows. you need to add a shadow caster 2d component to relevant objects.

normal maps also exist in the 2d lighting system

sprite masking allows you to modify the rendered sprite based on masks (e.g. you could do an x-ray machine by having a mask somewhere in the world and have the player sprite change to be a skeleton mixed based on the mask).
