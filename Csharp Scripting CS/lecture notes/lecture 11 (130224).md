tilemaps are used to render a grid of tiles on a 2D plane. you can have multiple tilemaps to form different layers. you can also use different layers to generate collision, interactibles, animated layers, etc.

tilemaps hold references to tile assets, each of which usually references a texture or part of a texture (if the latter, the texture holding all the tile textures is called a tileset). a collection of tiles can be made into a tile palette, which can then be used to easily paint tiles into a tilemap in your scene.

rule tiles can be used to place tiles automatically based on rules. useful for procedural generation since it's basically wave function collapse.

you can also create animated tiles which cycle through a set of frames.
