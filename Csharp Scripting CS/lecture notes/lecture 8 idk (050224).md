materials are configurations of parameters for shaders (i.e. they apply values to parameters defined on shaders)

unity has standard materials that provide useful stuff like opaque/transparent/cutout shading modes, metallic, specular, roughness, albedo and normal textures, etc etc.

shaders define parameters (aka `uniform`s) which are constants which are passed in by the material (i.e. defined at compile time).
