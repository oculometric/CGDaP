think about good software architecture design when programming (who'd have thought)

code that is written without any design patterns is hard to change and iterate on.

code that is tightly coupled (i.e. lots of different pieces of code being reliant on one another) makes extending code hard. also makes group working very hard. and difficult to optimise.

**the flyweight pattern** - save on resources where you can by sharing information between GameObjects

**the observer pattern** - rather than data being passed to specific objects, events can be used (e.g. broadcast an event to say that an enemy was killed, and a score-keeper can then listen for the event and respond appropriately)

**state machines** - a GameObject changes its behaviour based on an internal state. great for AI behaviour. keeps track of the state of the object and acts/changes state based on that and other conditions

**object pools** - instantiating is expensive on the fly, so having objects ready to go (in a pool) is a good idea. objects can be enabled and moved into place as needed.
