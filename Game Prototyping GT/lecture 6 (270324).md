## melee
things to consider
- crowd control (killing lots of enemies at once is satisfying)
- single target (heavier on impact mechanics, enemies individually have more real estate to feed the power of beating them)
- combo systems (combining inputs sequentially with timing and context to create new complex actions)
- enemy variation (different enemy designs require different abilities or moves to beat)

for impact:
- time slow to emphasise moments
- sound and particle effects

micro spectacle happens all the time in fights when special attacks land, etc.
macro spectacle is the every-increasing scale of stuff over the course of the game.
