## real time strategy games

require the player to be in multiple places at once. the command buffer pattern is useful, where individual transient player actions are added to a command buffer to happen incrementally (e.g. over turns, or when cooldowns finish).

can be difficult to build these games with controller/console controls. action wheel type systems can be useful.

RTS games need some kind of AI, both supporting and opposition. units need to be able to pathfind etc, but also there needs to be (unless the game is purely online) an 'AI player'. most RTS AI use Goal Oriented Action Planning: plan what the goal is, establish actions toward that goal, execute, repeat. the overall goal is frequently re-evaluated, and the sub-actions to achieve that goal. the AI will guess the player's stats, then try to counter them by improving the relevant stats/counter-stats.

all the AI doesn't have to run on every single unit. groups of units might have a leader who has the actual AI with many simpler units following him.

Z is an interesting looking game. for DOS.
