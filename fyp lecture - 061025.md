outline needs to contain actual detail and specifics. explain specifically research process, including primary/secondary-ness. would people be impacted by your research.

okay apparently everyone needs the proportionate form for industry feedback. but how do we tell them what questions/information we'll gather?

use the iterative model... but also you need to know what everything is going to be in advance. and you have like 5 weeks to do the actual project.
