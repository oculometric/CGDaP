categories of multiplayer game:
- symmetrical - everyone is playing in the same game world and playing with the same mechanics, e.g. elden ring (for invasion)
- asymmetrical - different gameplay experiences in the same world, players with different abilities or mechanics, e.g. valorant
- asynchronous - players are not directly in the same world at the same time, e.g. board games, clash of clans

cross play - players from different platforms playing together across platforms. this can cause some problems! different platforms have separate multiplayer matchmaking tools, they might have different RNG (see factorio), different play modes might work better for different games (aiming with a mouse)

players may have different aims during the game (variable player goals). some games focus on the social aspect, such as among us (social deduction games). there are also tabletop games.

multiplayer lobbies are a concept for managing connecting players together.  enables live customisation before starting the actual game, and makes it easy for people to organise.

another way to do this is drop-in/drop-out is also useful, e.g. minecraft. requires sending the joining client the entire world state.

players join servers via direct connection (server address/IP), or via server browser (a master server that knows about other servers/lobbies and acts as a middle man), or via matchmaking (server automatically places you into lobbies/servers with others based on rankings, etc).
