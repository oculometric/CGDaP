## threads
you can make multiple things run simultaneously. but not truly simultaneously! they get interleaved by an internal scheduler.

main might finish before the threads finish, so you need to manage and wait for them to finish.

multithreaded code is hard to debug.

multithreading is necessary for networking, especially with multiple players connecting.
