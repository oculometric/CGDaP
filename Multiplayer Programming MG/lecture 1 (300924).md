there are weekly quizzes on blackboard. do them!

the assessment: two components, written and practical. do both. submit by tuesday of week 9.

the written half:
	worth 30%
	critically review networking techniques
	academic paper using harvard referencing
	word count is 1800 +/- 10%

the  practical half:
	worth 70%
	networking framework and game using that framework
	basic codebase provided
	using MonoGame

check  the assessment document.

NO FORUM??????

## threads
you can make multiple things run simultaneously. but not truly simultaneously! they get interleaved by an internal scheduler.

main might finish before the threads finish, so you need to manage and wait for them to finish.
multithreaded code is hard to debug.
multithreading is necessary for networking, especially with multiple players connecting.

we'll be using a loopback address to run the server and clients on the same machine.

## Csharp
we're working using a framework MonoGame, which provides a bunch of useful stuff on top of .NET.

has built-in memory management. runs via a Common Language Runtime, compiling into Intermediate Language, which is compiled at runtime by Just In Time compilation.

object oriented, has inheritance etc. does not have pointers, but does differentiate object-vs-reference passing (structs are passed as objects, classes as references). automatic memory management and garbage collection.

no header files :( but also no semicolon after structs/classes :)

`public static void Main() { }`

basic data types (value):
	byte, sbyte
	ushort, short
	uint, int
	ulong, long
	char
	float, double
	decimal
	bool
	enum
	struct
	nullable?
basic data types (reference):
	class
	array
	interface
	delegate?

conditionals:
	if..else if...else
	switch (no fallthrough so wahts the FUCKING POINT)
loops:
	for
	while
	do while

just read the fucking powerpoint who cares.
