bring us the world, craig
# Networking Architecture
craig what the fuck are you talking about

simple peer-to-peer 
- each device in a network can send messages to others
- in a game context, every player shares their controller input with the other players, who apply it to their local copy of the game (replicated).
- no single point of failure
- need some system for deciding who's system should be used for synchronisation (i.e. who has the authority)
client-server
- may be ad-hoc (virtual server spun up as necessary) or dedicated (continuously running virtual server for persistent worlds)
- clients simulate the world, server has authority state
- clients perform IO and pass that data to the server
- easier to connect and scale
- consistent by default
- functionality for client and server can be separated
- single point of failure
- requires management, performance, and bandwidth (however, you can save a bunch by having one big machine running many virtual servers)

## Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model
data gets wrapped in layers of packaging for different nested protocols. we go down as we send, and back up when we receive:
- application - actually translates the data in the packet into something meaningful to the application
- presentation - presentation to the user/application, encryption + decryption
- session - controls user-to-user dialogue, direction and synchronisation
- transport - TCP / UDP
- network - routing using IP
- link - uses MAC addressing
- physical - physical communication over wires/cables/fibres

## TCP IP
- network interface replaces link and physical
- application replaces application, presentation, and session

about linking a particular link. more reliable. checksums, handshakes. flow control. automatic reordering of packets.
