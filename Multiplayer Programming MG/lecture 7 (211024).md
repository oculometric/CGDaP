## serialisation
the process of converting a data structure into bytes of binary data to be stored or transmitted.

BinaryFormatter can automatically serialise an object, but it's insecure. BinaryWriter and BinaryReader are different and do not suffer the same problems.

JSON and XML are another way of serialising things, as structured text.
```json
{
	"stuff" :
	{
		"a" : "34563",
		"b" : "hello"
		"array" : [ "thing", "other" ]
	}
}
```

you can mark stuff as serialisable using `[Serializable]`.

you still gotta write your own functions to serialise and deserialise stuff though. then the Json library will turn it into formatted json text.
