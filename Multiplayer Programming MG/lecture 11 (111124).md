game services. games platforms (consoles, steam, epic) provide their own toolkits for building multiplayer systems. they provide services.

they make multiplayer more secure, since the players IP addresses only need to be shared with a the platform's servers (and being a larger, unified platform body means they are more accountable). platforms will support features like friends, leaderboards, matchmaking, invite requests, parties, statistics/achievements.

usually these systems employ a client ID, rather than IP to connect people. the game servers translate the client ID into an IP.

to use these game services, you are usually required to create an application on the backend too. usually involves NDA.

spacewar, appid 480, is a steam example project.

steam API uses callbacks to receive responses to queries. supports P2P and client-server arch. steam has its own Steam Datagram Relay (i.e. its own mini second-layer internet) to route packets to players. steam can do sockets.
also has matchmaking/lobby system supporting 250 players per lobby.
steam supports 10,000 leaderboards per application, stored on steam's servers.

the adapter pattern may be useful - instead of your entire codebase talking to the steam api (and having problems when you try to support another api), you have a network manager, which your codebase talks to, which then talks to whatever the API is.
