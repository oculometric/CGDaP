my prediction - craig will overrun by wasting a load of time

Louise's prediction - same
_snoop dog????_


there is always latency: jitter - variation in latency. longer range -> higher latency
bandwidth is a measure of simultaneous capacity, not speed.

easy way to improve your latency is to just send less stuff.

relevance filtering - server decides only the things that need to be sent to each client. for instance, no point synchronising invisible players.

dead reckoning - don't update every frame, just update when velocity/acceleration changes, and recalculate position continuously locally (occasionally update other things to prevent desync)

quadratic/higher-order prediction functions can do curves (velocity, acceleration), etc.

convergence algorithms - instead of just snapping the position to be correct, we can interpolate onto the correct path (linear, cubic with splines)

predictive contracts - let objects handle themselves, only send updates when their state/behaviour changes

also you can just disguise latency (animation for a weapon/spell)
