## Personal Summary
I'm fascinated by graphics, rendering techniques and the technical side of art, image processing, and videogame development. I'm comfortable developing with both low and high level programming/scripting languages, and I have a solid understanding of mathematical principles, geometric reasoning, and linear algebra. I have an investigative attitude to learning which allows me to get to grips with complex systems easily and to produce novel solutions/concepts. My organisational and communication skills allow me to work effectively in a team and collaborate on large projects.

## Key Skills
Programming - familiar with C/C++, assembly, problem solving, debugging, best practice

Rendering and technical art - GLSL, underlying rendering math, shaders, optimisation techniques, 3D modelling, image/post-processing

Teamwork - friendly attitude, able to communicate ideas, familiar with source control and collaboration tools, game jams, 1up
