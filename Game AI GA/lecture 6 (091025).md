manhattan distance - sum of horizontal and vertical distance between origin and target (overestimates)
euclidean - sqrt(x^2 + y^2) (underestimates)
octile distance - ![[Pasted image 20250109193311.png]] (works when diagonal movement is allowed)
chebyshev - max(dx, dy) (works for orthogonal movement)

we can fix dijktras by using a distance heuristic. we track the estimated distance to the target from the current tile as well as the total cost travelled, and use the total to decide which node to explore next.

this is A*. its that simple.
