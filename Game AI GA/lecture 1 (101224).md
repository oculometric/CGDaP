forum nooooooooo.

reflective post each week:
- math
- steering
- pathfinding (Dijkstra and A*)
- advanced pathfinding
- decision making (FSM and FuSM)
- decision making (fuzzy logic and behaviour tree)

1000-word report on an AI system from a game of your choice (worth 30%).

AI Rules! (Ward, 2024)

- thinking humanly (cognitive modelling)
- thinking rationally (laws of thought, philosophical approach)
- acting humanly (turing test approach)
- acting rationally (rational agent approach, distinguished by autonomous control, achieve best expected outcome)

not concerned with learning like the current 'AI' tech hype (which is more so machine learning).

useful to have tools to develop AI systems (e.g. behaviour trees). AI programming sometimes is also responsible for camera systems.
