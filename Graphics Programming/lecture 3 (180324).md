freeGLUT is an open-source cross-platform OpenGL Utility Kit. it handles talking to the operating system and hardware to do windowing and input. GLUT means that we don't have to do any of this.

callbacks are functions that take function pointers as parameters. the specified function is then executed after an event (e.g. keyboard input or time delay).

`glutDispalyFunc(function_name);` will tell GLUT to call `function_name()` when it wants to display things on the screen.
`glutTimerFunc(delay, func, value);` will call the function...
`glutKeyboardFunc(func);` will call a function `void func(uint8_t key, int x, int y);` when a key is pressed
`glutKeyboardUpFunc(func);` will when the key goes up
`glutSpecialFunc` is for special keys like F1
`glutSpecialUpFunc` you get the idea
`glutMouseFunc(func);` will call a function `void func(int button, int x, int y);` when the mouse is clicked
`glutMotion`

because GLUT is a C library it can't do class methods. we use a helper function in a namespace to interface:
1. define a helper function in the helper namespace which will be the callback function
2. that helper function should call the corresponding callback method on the class reference
3. a reference to the global class (on which callbacks arrive) needs to be defined within the namespace (by declaring a pointer variable)
4. that global reference can be assigned when the class is initialised, and it should call a `set_global_reference` function inside the helper namespace
