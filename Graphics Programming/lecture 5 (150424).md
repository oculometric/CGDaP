materials reflect light in different ways. they may absorb or reflect different amounts of light in different wavelengths (in computers, of different RGB colours). however, some surfaces behave differently depending on the way light hits that surface.

when calculating the appearance of the surface to a viewer, we need to take into account:
- the direction the light is coming from
- the direction of the normal of the surface
- the direction of the viewing ray

in opengl, surfaces can be provided with basic texture either with solid colour, or with image textures.
the shading of an object comes in when light interacts with that surface, usually lighter where light hits the object, and darker where it is in shadow.

there are often more than one light in the scene. different types of lights produce different lighting behaviours. generally speaking, we consider three types of source:
- directional - suppose light rays are coming from an infinitely far away source and are all flowing in a particular direction
- point - light rays are radiating from the source, and flow in a direction radially outwards from the source
- ambient - light rays which are flowing in all directions from every point in space

when light hits a surface, some of it is absorbed, some of it is reflected or scattered and then may hit other surfaces or reach the camera.

local illumination means only considering lights relevant to individual objects (meaning light bouncing between objects is lost), while global illumination is the much more complex process of rendering light realistically bouncing between objects.

the final colour of the surface depends on the lighting that's hit the surface, and the colour of the light, surface, etc.

## in opengl

opengl is a state machine, so in order to get it to do lighting, we need to set different states.

opengl implements the lambertian equation.

it supports 8 lights, each of which has a colour and a position.
the object material specifies what fraction of the light is reflected (as a colour) in different parts of the lighting equation (e.g. for ambient, diffuse, specular).

opengl light is considered to be broken into four components (really these are properties of the material, but they're components in the lighting equation):
- emissive - additive colour which is intrinsic to the surface (i.e. not multiplied by lighting)
- specular - additive colour which is multiplied by a reflective-exponent factor and by the lighting colour (i.e. the more aligned the eye is with the reflected light ray in the surface, the brighter the colour), and also by the distance to the light and falloff
- diffuse - additive colour which is multiplied by the different between the surface normal and the light vector (i.e. the more tangential light is, the darker the surface), and also by the distance to the light and falloff
- ambient - additive colour which does not take the position or angle of light into account

the meaningful vectors for light are below:
![[Pasted image 20240415153804.png]]
L - incident vector, direction the light is going in, from the point on the surface to the light
R - reflected vector, L reflected in N (i.e. direction of reflected light)
N - normal vector to the surface
V - view vector, from the point on the surface to the camera

for specular light, the intensity varies dependent on the angle between R and V.
for diffuse light, the intensity varies dependent on the angle between N and L.
for emission and ambient light, the intensity does not vary at all.
