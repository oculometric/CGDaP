parts of game mechanics:
- goals (e.g. finish the level)
- rules (e.g. ...)
- challenges (e.g. limited stamina, enemies attacking the player)

mechanics are interactions between gameplay elements. in a platformer, jumping is a mechanic for instance. lots of open world games have fast travel/driving/riding mechanics.

games are primarily designed around core mechanics (the fundamentals of the gameplay), and have secondary mechanics to add more complexity and gameplay strategies to the game (e.g. core mechanic: killing enemy, secondary mechanic: they explode and deal damage on death).

game mechanics must have some impact on the gameplay in some way, i.e. aesthetics/outfits are not mechanics.

games are more than just the mechanics! art, models, animations, sounds, particles, shading, etc.


a prototype is a proof of concept to prove a game design is fun, to communicate design intentions in an iterative design process (design, prototype, evaluate, repeat).

## unreal engine

trims hide hard edges and add detail by adding things like pillars.
clutter is added on floor and walls to add visual detail and functionality (breaks up emptiness).
