we deal with code and data. data is usually (now) formatted in a platform agnostic way, created by designers/artists, an engine will condition, package, process those assets into an efficient, portable format, which will then be loaded appropriately at runtime as required.

art asset pipeline is usually broken into many parts:
- concept art
- 3D modelling
- texturing
- animator/rigger
audio asset pipeline might be simpler.

games have many assets, each of which may undergo many revisions.

game development makes use of tools. often made in-house for specific workflow/requirements. source control. separating data from code (i.e. no recompiling when data changes). makes collaboration easier/more efficient.

3D objects are usually formatted as OBJ, FBX, GLTF, USD. or some internal format.

organise your files god damn it. avoid having too many files in a single list.

root
|-> Code
	|-> Headers
	|-> Implementations
|-> Meshes
|-> Animations
|-> Materials
|-> Shaders
|-> Textures
|-> Scenes
|-> Audio
	|-> Music
	|-> SFX

often the solution is to specifically prefix names with a magic symbol. e.g. `anim_Thing` for animations, `mat_Other` for materials, `sm_Name` for static meshes, etc. also metadata will provide a lot of info about assets. as well as automatic metadata, like creator, modification date, format/type, we can manually tag things.

we usually need to keep an asset database for tracking assets and their intermediate internal objects. usually in XML, JSON, YAML.

XML is very widely supported, but considered legacy now. also looks jank.
JSON is better, nested key-value pairs. actually stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
YAML is powered by indentation. fuck indentation.

tools should be aimed at tech literate individuals.

the automation paradox - write a program to automate a tedious task, but automating it actually ends up costing more time than you saved by automation.

scope creep? generalisability of solution? missing edge cases? automation is dangerous.

games need tools. sometimes they need dedicated tools. but always start simple.
