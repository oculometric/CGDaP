# environmental effects
- skyboxes (cube maps) - use texture cube, sample in a direction
- environment mapping - basically do the same thing, but direction vector is based on reflection
- reflective surfaces
- refractive surfaces
- stencil buffer - depth stencil buffer state required. you can use the stencil buffer as a filter for future rendering
	- mirros
	- impossible geometry
	- portals
- billboarding - just putting a texture on a quad and having it always face the camera
- fog - great way to limit visual distance. also gives atmosphere
