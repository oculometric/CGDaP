rotational forces (torques) can be accumulated in the same way as linear forces.

angular velocity is a three-element vector composed of an axis of rotation and a rate of angular change.

angular velocity and acceleration behave exactly the same as normal velocity and acceleration (first and second derivatives).

$$\theta'=\theta + \frac{\Delta t}{2}\omega\theta$$
theta' is the new orientation, theta is the old, t is time, omega is angular velocity.

$$\dot q = \dot \theta \times (q - p) + \dot p$$
world velocity of a point is the position of the point relative to the object origin, cross product with the angular velocity, plus the linear velocity in world space.

angular velocity damping is $\dot \theta' = \dot \theta * damping + \ddot \theta * t$

sequence:

1. calculate torque
2. calculate inertial tensor
3. calculate angular acceleration
4. update angular velocity
5. apply drag
6. update orientation
