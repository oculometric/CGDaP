particle systems form by having an array of points follow a set of physical (and non physical) rules. very useful for effects and simulations.

use object pooling to accelerate particle simulations.

particle engine design: particle element storing position etc, particle system managing particles, particle manager which manages particle systems.

easy to apply forces. maybe adding extra forces due to special rules, flow, etc.
