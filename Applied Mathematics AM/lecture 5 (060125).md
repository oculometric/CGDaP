quaternions are an alternative rotation method to euler angles.
- avoids gimbal lock
- no sequential transformations
- smooth rotation between orientations is easy
- minimises matrix multiplications

gimbal lock occurs in eulers when two axes become aligned, losing a degree of freedom. not just relevant to videogames.

$$i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$$
$$ij = k$$
$$ji = -k$$
etc. complex numbers in 3D.

quaternions represent coordinates on a 4-dimensional hypersphere.
expressed as $q=w + xi + yj + zk$, or $q=(w, V)$
inverse: $q^* = q^{-1} = \bar q = (w, -V)$

length/normalisation is just the same as with 3-vectors. sum of squared components.

multiplication - not commutative!! $$q_0 \times q_1 = (w_0 w_1 - V_0 V_1, w_0V_1 + w_1V_0 + V_0 \times V_1)$$
not sure what the $V_0V_1$ and $V_0 \times V_1$ mean. dot product and cross product? multiplication with the complex components?
also in DirectX, the last addition is a subtraction (JPL convention).

rotating a vector: $p' = qpq^{-1}$

to combine rotations, multiply them in reverse order: $q' = q_2 q_1$

interpolation can be done with lerping (which must be reprojected and will result in speed artefacts) or slerping (spherical linear interpolating).

in DX11 quaternions are stored in an XMVECTOR in the (x, y, z, w) order. also most functions which involve angles work in radians.
