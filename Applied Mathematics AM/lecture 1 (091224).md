need to choose a physics model which fits the needs
approximate real-world physics (but also have artistic control)

physics in older games involve simple projectile motion. now a more general physics engine is used which simulates the motion and collision of objects which can then be used to implement behaviour such as projectile motion. abstract physics away so the game engine can just say 'make this fall'. physics engine doesn't know about the game.

advantages:
+ code reuse
+ time saving
+ multiple effects working together
+ more maintainable

disadvantages:
- worse performance
- passing data around

## approaches
- point mass physics (use for particles, no dimensions, no rotations, not useful for complex objects)
- mass aggregate (treats objects as if they are made of lots of small masses, points may be rigidly or elastically connected)
- rigid body (size and shape, collisions in fine detail, angular rotation behaves realistically, more difficult mathematics, may be attached to one another)

## basic requirements
- vector maths
- gravity
- drag
- force-based movement

use a physics loop - apply forces, update positions/rotations, check for collisions, solve collisions and constraints, render objects.
usually do multiple physics steps per frame.

frame time is important for calculations, obviously (since most of our variables depend on time). usually physics engines use a fixed timestep. 

make the game object a middleman class which points to appearance, behaviour, transform, etc components.



remember that acceleration due to gravity experienced by an object is the same regardless of mass!
