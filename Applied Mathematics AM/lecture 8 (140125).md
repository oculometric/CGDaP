rigid body - the distance between any two points on the body remains the same

rotation is movement from one orientation to another (in the same way velocity is movement from one position to another).

objects begin rotating when you apply a force to them tangentially (i.e. not through the center of mass).

in physics, rotation will occur around the center of mass, but games sometimes just use object origin.

use matrices to store orientation, however we need something which can be interpolated between orientations. so we use quaternions.

rotational physics has:
force -> torque
acceleration -> angular acceleration
velocity -> angular velocity
position -> orientation
mass -> moment of inertia (resistance to angular acceleration)

torque calculated: $\tau = p_F \times F$, where $p_F$ is the point at which the force is being applied, cross product with the force.

the moment of inertia is a measure of how hard it is to change the object's rotational speed in that direction (ie around a particular axis)

inertia tensor: 3x3 matrix where the leading diagonal is the moment of inertia along each major axis. the remaining values contain 'products of inertia', which represent the tendency of an object to rotate in a direction different from the direction in which the force is applied. common to have zero for these.
