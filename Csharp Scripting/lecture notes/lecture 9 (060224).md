juiciness relates to the feel of the game, about visual embellishments and responsiveness to action/feedback to player. not bland. not usually considered at the prototyping level. contributes to making games feel polished

things for juiciness:
- particles when enemies are hit
- particles when the player lands on the ground
- trails for movement
- flashing the screen or particles
- flashing sprites when they get hit/etc
- screen shake
- general extra sprites, particles, and VFX to spice up how responsive a game feels

```
private Coroutine flash = null;

...on hit...
if (flash == null) flash = StartCoroutine(DamageFlash(gameObject))

private IEnumerator DamageFlash(GameObject obj)
{
		// set sprite colour 
		yield return new WaitForSeconds(0.1f);
		// set sprite colour back
		flash = null;
}

new WaitForEndOfFrame()
```
