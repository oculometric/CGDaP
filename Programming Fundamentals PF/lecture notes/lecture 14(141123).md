- inheritance is the concept of a child subclass deriving members and methods from a more generic parent superclass
- child classes can use all public and protected members
- child classes can override, and add new members and methods
- syntax example:
`class Dog : Animal` for a Dog which inherits from Animal
- members which are inherited become private in the subclass by default, to change that you can do
```
class Dog : public Animal // privateness remains the same
class Dog : private Animal // all inherited members become private, cant be further inherited
class Dog : protected Animal // public members become protected
```
- when constructing, the parent constructor is called first, then the specific class constructor is called (for a chain of inheritance, they are called top-to-bottom)
- you can specify which constructor you want to call like this:
`MyClass(int i) : Parent(int i)`


- overloading (aka ad hoc polymorphism) means replacing the functionality of a parent class's function
```
virtual void Render(); // in the parent class

void Render() override // in the child class
```
- functions need to be virtual in order to be overloaded

- a class can be marked as `final` cannot be inherited any further
- ditto with a function for overriding

- C++ classes can inherit from multiple parent classes
- this introduces the diamond problem, where class A inherits from B and C, each of which inherits from D (i.e. we would be duplicating functionality from D)
- the solution is to mark the class's inheritance as virtual `class Thing : virtual public Parent`

- subtyping like this is useful since we can write code to handle general parent types, and pass it individual subclasses, e.g. a function that takes `Vehicle` can be passed `Car` (car should inherit from vehicle)

- pure virtual functions are functions on a parent class which **must** be implemented by child classes `virtual void func() = 0;`
- allows us to create abstract classes and interfaces for behaviours which a subclass should display
