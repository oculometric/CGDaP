- strings 
	- `std` provides several types of strings, for standard `std::string`, wide (2 byte) `std::wstring`, really wide `std::u32string`
	- the C-type string is really a `const char*`, i.e. a pointer to a block of characters: this must be null-terminated to indicate the end of the array (since the `const char*` doesn't have any length/end information about it)
	- all `std` strings inherit from `std::basic_string` which defines a general sequence of characters
	- string literals are C-type strings, but we may need to specify how we're expecting our string to be stored by prefixing it if we want special things like Unicode:
		- for `wstring`, `L"text"`
		- for `u32string`, `u8"text"`
	- strings can be indexed into just like an array (C-strings are arrays, and `std::basic_string` implements the `[]` operator), and assigned and read from like arrays in this way
- exceptions
	- exceptions get thrown at runtime when things go wrong
	- C++ enabled detecting and handling of exceptions, so functions/modules can tell the rest of a program that something went critically wrong
	- the C++ standard differentiates between errors and exceptions: errors occur at the hardware level, exceptions occur at the program software level
	- exceptions can be handled with the `try { <code> } catch (exception e) { <handle error e> }`, needs `#include <exception>`
	- you can build your own exceptions and throw them in exceptional circumstances
- files
	- using `#include <fstream>`
	- we can do input and output with data streams (`cout` and `cin` are examples of this)
	- files can be opened as data streams, as `ifstream` or `ofstream`. you need to `.open(<file>)` **AND** `.close()` files
