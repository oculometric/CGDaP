course text to read: D S Malik "C++ Programming: Program Design Including Data Structures" 8th Edition. 

three tips
1. think like a computer, use debugging tools and understand what the code is doing at the lowest level
2. break problems down, describe it out loud to other people
3. think outside the box, learn what C++ has to offer built-in

computer just execute **instructions**. sequentially, one-at-a-time. you can make it skip or jump backwards and forwards, navigating like this is **control flow**.

control flow can be **sequential** (one after another), **iterative** (repeating one section again and again), **selective** (branching or doing different things based on a condition)

programming languages are intermediates for communicating instructions to a computer. high-level languages are closer to natural language, and easier to understand; low-level languages are closer to the metal and are more direct, harder to understand, but may give greater control over the hardware (they may be 1-to-1 with machine code).

compilers convert source code into machine code (i.e. 1s and 0s).
