- arrays are declared like this in C++ `int <identifier>[<array size>] = { 1, 2, 5, 45, 20, etc};`
- or like this `float <indentifier>[<array size>];`, this `string <idenfitier>[] = { "str1", "str2" }; // will be length 2`
- arrays are accessed with square brackets:
```
int arr[10];
arr[3] = 5; // sets the 4th element (we index from zero, so 0,1,2,3,...)
```
- if you try to access part of an array outside its bounds (i.e. less than zero or >= length) will cause an error: this might cause you to overwrite another part of memory off the end of the array, or cause a segmentation fault if you try to access memory not allocated to your program
- arrays are very useful with loops to reduce duplicating code (or make it dynamic on the number of items)
- you can nest for loops and arrays, `int map2d[10][10];`
- you can also define dynamic arrays (or at least, defined at runtime) using `new int[<length>]`
- instead you can use a `std::vector<int>`! proper dynamic array, you can template it with whatever type in the angle brackets, they handle dynamic allocation so you can add as many elements as you like using `vector_variable.push_back(element);`, accessed the same as arrays
- has a bunch of utility functions like `.clear()`, `.erase([start, end])`, `.size()`, `.sort()`
- other types of containers are linked lists (nodes containing data, and pointers, see other notes) which are useful for not having to be contiguous (traditional arrays are contiguous), `std::map` which stores data as key-value pairs (indexed using the key which must be unique, dynamically allocated like `std::vector`)
