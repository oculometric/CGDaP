hoo boy its computer architecture

## binary summary
- 1s and 0s, analogous to high/low voltage
- 8 bits in a byte, 4 bits in a nibble, each bit is 1 or 0
- a word is the standard data handling size of an architecture, usually 16, 32, 64 bits

a **Turing machine** is a system which is able to emulate/perform the task of any other computational machine.

**von Neumann architecture** is a concept of machine storage where instructions and data (i.e. parameters) are stored together in a shared memory unit. very flexible

Intel 8086 uses an 8-bit word and its architecture is the basis of all modern CPUs (i.e. x86). good job intel i guess

## here it is baby the fetch decode execute cycle
**FETCH**
1. put the desired address in the MBR (memory buffer register)
2. gets copied to the memory address bus
3. memory gets the result, puts it on the memory data bus
4. gets copied into the MDR (memory data register)
**DECODE**
5. gets copied into the CIR (current instruction register)
6. CPU breaks down instruction and decides what to do, potentially fetching more things from memory (i.e. go back to fetch)
**EXECUTE**
**WRITE BACK**

instructions will be pipelined, meaning while one instruction is being decoded, the next can be fetched, etc.

modern CPUs will be processing multiple instructions per clock cycle, as well as having multiple processing cores running concurrently.

GPUs are distinct from CPUs because they are optimised to perform lots and lots of parallelised vector/matrix operations, whilst CPUs have a wider range of operations they can do
