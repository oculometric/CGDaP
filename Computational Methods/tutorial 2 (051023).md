1. 2700 BC was the abacus (i.e. 4723 years ago). counting systems go back as far as 40,000BC, strictly 6,000BC
2. Von Neumann architecture has a single unified memory system (i.e. programs and data stored together interchangeably), more bottlenecked compared to Harvard which stores programs and data separately, has separate data buses
3. a Turing machine is a conceptual machine which is capable of emulating the functionality of any other conceptual machine
4. easy to do maths with, works with switches, easy to detect high/low voltage (versus say, 10 different voltages)
