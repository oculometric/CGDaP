- brute force is an exhaustive attempt to solve a problem, where you just try every possibility in order to find the best solution
- worst case scenario of all programming methods. numbers and costs get very big very quickly
- the enigma machine
	- 3 main obfuscation methods:
	- every time you press a key, a rotor turns. they can be placed in a specific order, with specific starting positions
	- there's a plugboard for rerouting letters to other letters
	- 3 rotors chosen from 5, order matters, so 60 combinations
	- each rotor has 26 starting positions, so 26^3
	- 10 pairs of letters can be plugboarded, so $\frac{26!}{6!*10!*2^(10)}$
	- multiplied all together, this is very big. a lot of possible ciphers
	- background knowledge:
		- no letter can ever be enciphered as itself
		- you can guess what will be sent, e.g. starting/ending with the time, 'weather report'
		- from there: try a setting configuration, if a letter encrypts to itself, throw out and start again with different settings
		- 'e' 'a' 's' and 't' are common letters, so analysing their relative frequency can be helpful
		- if we assume TP is a plugboard pair, but find LP should also be a pair, we know this must be wrong, so we throw out this solution
		- the Bombe worked its way through these eliminations to give some kind of answer after 20 minutes, primarily by using a divide and conquer strategy
