1. numbers are a tool for representing amounts of stuff concisely
2. 1.618 is the start of the golden ratio, an irrational number representing the solution of the following equation. it's used as a guide for composition. as well as its definition as the ratio between sides of an extended square, it can be used to arrange points equally around a sphere
   $$\frac{a+b}{a} = \frac{a}{b}$$
   $$b(a+b)=a^2$$
   $$ab + b^2 = a^2$$
   $$b^2 + b - 1 = 0$$
   $$b = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1-4(-1)}}{2}$$
   $$b=\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$$
   $$b \approx 1.618$$
3. the Fibonacci sequence represents a form of exponential growth, where the two previous numbers are added to produce the next. the Fibonacci sequence approximates the golden ratio precisely because it is an analog for it. the definition of the phi, as the ratios between side lengths is a direct analogy for incremental adding in the Fibonacci sequence and ratio between terms
4. DNA bases pair only to their binary counterparts, A with T and C with G; DNA is only composed of the two values, AT or CG; electron spin; particle charge; quark pairs
5. by understanding the world in terms of maths, physical laws based on physical properties and quantities (and by the fact it appears to be deterministic on a large scale over a limited time period) we can predict it by solving those mathematical functions and equations which predict the next step in time
