- asymptotic notation is a way of describing how long our algorithms take to run (**time complexity**), relative to the number of items put into it
- measures efficiency rather than time
- can be expressed as Big Theta, Big Omega, and Big O
	- theta - average-case time complexity
	- omega - best-case time complexity (e.g. sorting an already sorted list)
	- o - worst-case time complexity (e.g. sorting a completely reversed list)
	- in all of these, `n` represents the number of items/elements involved
- examples, in big O
	- `O(1)` - always takes the same time, **constant time**
	- `O(n)` - time directly related to number of items, **linear time**
	- `O(n^2)` - time proportional to number of square of items, **polynomial time**, can also be things like `O(n^3)`, etc
- for instance inserting an item into a linked list:
	- Worst case is `O(n)`, since we may have to walk all the way to the end of the list (length n) to insert
	- Best case is `Omega(1)`, since we could insert right at the start and only do one operation
	- Average case is `Theta(n/2)`, since on average we would have to go halfway through the list of length n
- inserting into trees:
	- Worst case is `O(n)` for an unbalanced tree, since we'd have to walk all the way down a line of n nodes
	- Best case is `Omega(1)`, since we could be inserting as a child of the root node
	- Average case is `Theta(log(n))` for a perfectly balanced tree, since the binary tree divides the number of nodes we need to step over each level by 2 (so it's actually `log2(n)`, we cut away half the tree at each branch)
	- binary trees, usually structured such that left children are less than the parent, and right children are greater, are therefore very efficient in terms of data that needs to be searched or inserted into
- we mostly just use Big O notation, because it's very hard to find what the average case is (and the best case is usually just 1). also worst case is what matters most of the time, since really we want to keep the worst case as low as possible. the better the worst case scenario, usually the better the average case will be too
