- data structure is a template for how to store data within a program
- queue
	- first in first out
	- front and back pointers
	- new items enqueued to back
	- dequeuing items removes them from the front
	- queue may be shuffled if we run out of allocated space to move everything up (i.e. no space left at the front in order to make space at the back), preserving order
- stack
	- first in last out
	- bottom and top pointers (sometimes only the top/stack pointer)
	- items added (pushed) at the top
	- items removed (popped) from the top
	- when the stack is full everything bad happens 'undefined behaviour' or segfaults
- map/dictionary
	- stored as key-value pairs
	- values are accessed using their corresponding key, which is a unique identifier (usually)
	- data order is not preserved once the data is entered into the structure
	- map implementations may have sorting where the key is hashed and then it can be indexed quickly
	- does not require traversal, dequeuing, etc to access data
- linked list
	- constructed of nodes, each nodes represents a single element in the list
	- each node keeps a pointer to the next node in the list
	- the program just needs to keep a pointer to the start of the list (i.e. first node)
	- can have items deleted or added anywhere in the list, since elements do not have to be stored contiguously in memory
	- singly linked list contains a pointer to the next node only
	- doubly linked list contains pointers for both the previous and next nodes, allowing the list to be traversed in any direction
	- start node is not allowed to hold data
	- last node always has its next set to null (there is nothing after it in the list)
- trees
	- collection of nodes where multiple nodes can follow on from each node
	- trees can branch but **do not** have cycles
	- binary trees have at most 2 child nodes per node
	- ternary three
	- N-ary any number
	- trees have a root node, of which all other nodes are descendants
	- branch nodes have a parent and at least one child
	- leaf nodes have a parent but no child nodes
	- any tree can have a subtree (i.e. node with children)
	- trees are a type of graph
- graphs
	- collection of nodes where each node can link to one or more other nodes
	- the most abstract form
	- graphs may branch and may have cycles
	- nodes in a graph are called vertices, connections between them are called edges
	- graphs show which vertices are connected to other vertices
	- edges may have weights/costs for traversing them
	- may be directed (i.e. connections are directional and you can only go one way) or undirected (connections are bi-directional and can be traversed in either direction)
	- graph theory is the core of a lot of high-level computing
