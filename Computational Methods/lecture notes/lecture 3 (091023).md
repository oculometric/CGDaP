- number systems are ways of representing numbers
- standard positional notation, often referred to as bases (we talk in base 10, computers base 2)
- each digit ascends in value by a power of the base number:
	e.g., 5923 is made of $$(5\times10^3) + (9\times10^2) + (2\times10^1) + (3\times10^0)$$
- octal is base 8 (i.e half of hexadecimal), represented by 0-7 in each digit
- hexadecimal, base 16, represented by 0-9,A-F in each digit. good for shortening bytes into **readable** values, 4 bits can be represented as one hex digit, so a byte is 2 hex digits
- to convert from base 10 to base n:
```
e.g. base-10 to base-n
Let new_base = input from user
Let number = input from user
Let converted = ""
While number != 0:
	Let remainder = number Modulus new_base
	Append remainder to converted as text
	number = (number / new_base) Rounded down
End While
Output converted
```

351 dec:
	351 / 8 = 43 | 7
	43 / 8 = 5 | 3
	5 / 8 = 0 | 5

= 537 oct

```
e.g. base-n to base-10
Let old_base = input from user
Let number = input from user
Let converted = ""
Let index = 0
While number > 0:
	Let digit = number Modulus old_base
	Let value = digit * (old_base ^ number)
	Append value to converted as text
	number = (number / old_base) Rounded down
	Increment index
End While
Output converted
```

634 oct:
	6 * 64
	3 * 8
	4 * 1
	= 412 dec

- all letters are also represented by numbers, we just tell the computer to interpret it as a character
- a character set tells the computer what letter symbol corresponds to a particular number
- ASCII is a single byte character set, Unicode is an expandable character set which includes all kinds of characters and writing methods from different languages and writing systems, as well as emoji
