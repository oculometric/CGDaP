algorithms with the same input should always give the same output

## algorithm expression
- natural language - wide audience; imprecise
- flowcharts - clearly shows steps, decisions; introduces technicality; visual symbols for different kinds of tasks
- pseudocode - looks code-like; precise and compact; faster to produce/easier to format than a flowchart; readable by non-programmers, can be turned into code fairly directly

## flowchart guide:
- rectangles = processes (actions)
- rounded boxes = terminals (start and end)
- diamonds = decisions (checking inputs, waiting for status, branching)
- parallelograms = inputs

## pseudocode
is just structured natural language. mathematical operators are written out. keywords are things like:
`Let number = input from user`
`If thing is other thing then`
`Output "text"`
`Else`
`End If`
