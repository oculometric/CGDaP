ITS GRAPH THEORY TIME BABY WOOOO


- graphs consist of vertices and edges, edges join vertices
- graphs may be directed (edges can only be traversed in a particular direction), or undirected
- roads, the web, and social networks can all be represented as graphs
- graph notation $G=(V,E)$ where V is the full set of vertices, and E is the full set of edges
- we can say that $n=|V|$, where n is the number of vertices
- we can represent a graph in different ways
	- adjacency matrix, 2D array of edge weights between different nodes
	- adjacency list of vertices and edges, each with relevant pointers and data to step between vertices
	- pictorial representation
- graphs may have cycles (i.e. loops)
- a spanning tree is a subset of a graph which has no cycles
- a minimum spanning tree is the spanning tree with the lowest total edge weight

- Prim's algorithm
	- take a graph and pick any start node
	- add the lowest weighted edge out of this node, extending the tree
	- next choose the lowest weighted edge out of either of these nodes, making sure we aren't adding a node we already have
	- repeat until we have visited every node
	- since each iteration of n nodes checks m edges, our time complexity is $O(mn)$ depending on implementation
```
Let X be the set of all visited vertices
Let T be the set of all edges in the minimum spanning tree

While there is an edge between v and w where v is contained in X and w is not
	Find an edge between a and b such that is the lowest edge value between any two v and w
	Add vertex b to X
	Add edge a, b to T
End While
```

- Kruskal's algorithm
	- start with the cheapest edge in the graph, add the vertices to the subgraph
	- repeat this until the entire graph is connected, ensuring no cycles are created
	- dependent on sorting algorithm, this will run in worst case $O(mn)$ again
```
Let T be the set of visited edges

Presort list of edges E by cost
For each edge e in E in increasing order
	If T union {e} does not cause a cycle
		Add e to T
	End If
End For
```

- Prim's works faster on dense graphs (many edges)
- Kruskal's works faster on sparse graph (few edges)
- neither of these are guaranteed to produce an optimal way of getting from one node to another, they just produce a minimum spanning tree

- the travelling salesman and chinese postman problems are both examples of unsolved hard graph problems
