- polynomial problems - can be solved and verified in $O(n^k)$ or $O(n\log(n))$
	- $k$ is some constant
	- constant and linear time are both polynomial time ($k=0$ or $k=1$)
- intractable problems - can be solved and verified in $O(n!)$, $O(k^n)$, or $O(n^n)$ 
	- algorithm can be constructed to solve and verify in a reasonable amount of time
- seemingly intractable problems may be solved in polynomial time when approached correctly (greedy strategies, dynamic, top-down, heuristics)
- NP-complete problems can have their solutions **verified** in polynomial time (e.g. we can traverse our graph, and find the shortest path between two nodes), but do not have a polynomial time **solution** algorithm
- non-deterministic means that it's not possible to find a definite, deterministic way of finding the solution for a problem, but that it is possible to **verify** a solution (i.e. you have to brute force it in some respect)
- there is a significant debate of whether or not for every problem which exists in P (polynomial time problems) there is a polynomial time solution and verification algorithm (i.e. is NP = P?)
	- if yes, yay!
	- if no, aww :(
- NP hard problems are problems which are 'at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP', where they cannot be solved in polynomial time
- i.e. NP complete problems are the overlap between NP hard (can't be solved in P time) and NP (can be verified in polynomial time)
- consider space complexity as well as time!

types of problem
- decision problems - problems where you're asked to verify if something is true
	- hamiltonian cycle problem - given a connected graph, is it possible to visit each node exactly once in a continuous circuit and return to the start point?
- optimisation problems - problems where you're asked to find an 'optimal' solution according to some set of criteria
	- hamiltonian cycle problem can be modified to ask how many edges need to be added such that a graph is hamiltonian
	- travelling salesman problem

examples of problems
- polynomial (P)
	- graph connectedness - is a set of vertices and edges connected
	- minimum spanning trees (greedy, kruskal)
- NP hard
	- halting problem - given a program and its input, will that program finish
	- any decision problem which may take an infinite time to find out

- cliques
	- when all possible edges of a graph on $n$ vertices are present (i.e. every node connected withe every other node), the graph is a clique of $K_n$
	- it has $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ edges
	- does a graph contain a clique? is an example of a decision problem
	- what is the largest clique within a graph? is an example of an optimisation problem

- satisfiability problem
	- given a boolean formula $f$
	- is there a setting of the inputs which makes $f$ true
	- brute force could be used
	- some solutions could be pruned
	- boolean logic simplifications

- we say that A reduces to B when solving B solves A: B is therefore more powerful or more difficult than A
- if a polynomial number of instances of solving B are required for A, then there is a polynomial-time reduction
- when problems are parsimonious they must be of equal complexity
