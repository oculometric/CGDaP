pathfinding
- Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph
- the shortest path may not be the most direct path
- no intermediate vertex may appear twice on the path (in that case we have formed a loop)
- if C is within the shortest path from A to B, then A to C and C to B are also the shortest paths between those nodes
- graphs can be used to model/represent various different problems

adjacency matrices
- table representing the edge weights between vertices
- if two verts aren't connected, they can be denoted with a special value like -1 or infinity
- since there are two copies of each pair of nodes in the table (AB and BA) this can also represent a directed graph by having different weights (or specials like -1) for the different traversal directions

Dijkstra's algorithm
1. create a list of nodes to examine, empty
2. create a list of nodes and the cheapest route and cost to reach them, empty
3. start at the designated starting point S
4. while there are nodes to examine in the list:
	1. mark this vertex V as visited, remove it from the list of nodes to examine
	2. look at each edge E coming out of V going to V_2:
		1. if the shortest route to V plus the edge weight of E to get to V_2 is less than the previous shortest route to V_2 (if not yet seen, assume infinity), update the shortest route to V_2 with the new cheapest route and cost
		2. if V_2 is unvisited, add it to the list of nodes to look at next
5. look for the entry for ending point S_2 in the list of nodes and read the cheapest route and cost to reach it, this will be the shortest path between S and S_2
- this is a hybrid between a dynamic approach (it updates values to optimise subproblems) and a greedy algorithm (it picks the cheapest route at each step)

Warshall's algorithm finds the shortest route between all pairs of two cities
1. initialise the adjacency matrix, and another matrix to store routes with the same dimension as the adjacency matrix, infinity if not directly connected
2. for every node I in the graph:
	1. for every node J in the graph:
		1. for every node K in the graph:
			1. if the adjacency distance between I and J is greater than the distance between I and K plus distance between K and J, then update the adjacency table so that the distance between I and J is I->K + K->J, and make a note of the route needed to achieve that distance
3. now have a table of the shortest distances between every pair of nodes
- has complexity approximately $O(n^3)$ time, but $O(n^2)$ space

A* algorithm
- variation of dijktra's
- weights choice of nodes by how far the next node is geographically from the target destination
