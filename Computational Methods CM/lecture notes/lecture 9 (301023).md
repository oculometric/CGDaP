- searching is important
- the slowest form of searching is just a linear search, $O(n)$ where we walk potentially all the way to the end of the list (`n` items)
- it's often useful to sort your data before you try to search it. this way you can make inferences to find it faster.
- tree structures can be used to accelerate searching
- one example of a better search is a **binary search**:
	- we start by looking at the middle element of a sorted list
	- if our search item is greater in value than the middle item, we then repeat this process but looking only at the half of the list to the right (after) the middle item
	- if our search item is less in value than the middle item, we repeat the process looking at the left half of the list
	- we repeat this again and again until we have no items left (i.e. not found) or we have found the item
	- this has complexity $O(\log(n))$ 
	- we can also represent this as a tree of solutions (a binary tree), following a similar search strategy starting at the root node (which should ideally be the middle of the list for a balanced tree)
- other search algorithms
	- sentinel linear search
	- interpolation search
	- exponential search
	- fibonacci search
