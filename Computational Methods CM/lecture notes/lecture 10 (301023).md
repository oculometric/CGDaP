- greedy algorithms make the optimal solution at the exact moment they make the decision. they _can_ give the best result, but not always
- they do not look ahead, and don't care if the final result is absolutely optimal
- greedy algorithms are one method of pathfinding, Dijkstra's algorithm is an improvement of a greedy algorithm
- examples of greedy algorithms
	- selection sort - selecting the lowest first
	- job scheduling - most people will do their shortest chore first
	- Prim's minimal spanning tree algorithm
	- Kruskal's minimal spanning tree algorithm
	- Dijkstra's minimal spanning tree algorithm
