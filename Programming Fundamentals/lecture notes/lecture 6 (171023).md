## the compiler
- the preprocessor
	- happens before the compiler
	- we can use directives to tell the processor what to do, these start with a hashtag
	- for example, `#include` which will grab the contents of the target file and insert it into the top of your file. angled brackets will cause the preprocessor to search in system libraries, whereas quotation marks will search the current directory/project
	- `#ifdef <condition>...#endif` can be used to enable or disable which code gets compiled depending on conditions **at compile time**, for doing things like changing behaviour based on the platform compiled for. `#ifndef` is also useful, it triggers if the condition is not defined
	- `#pragma once` to ensure a file only gets included/compiled once
	- `#error` to trigger an error
	- `#define` to define a macro, which will be automatically expanded during preprocessing. works like a find-replace command formatted like `#define <text to find> <text to replace it with>`. does not care about the code at all, so you can do some funny bits. you can also define parameters, such as `#define MULTIPLY(x,y) (x*y)`
	- you can also do `#undef` to delete a previously defined macro
	- outputs modified source code
- the compiler
	- takes source code and converts it into the machine instructions (**object code**)
- the linker
	- takes object code and packages it (including putting `main` at a certain place in the executable) for the operating system
	- it may grab external library files as object code and package them into the executable
	- the resulting object may alternatively be a .dll or other library file

^ Complete (mostly) compilation process

- header (.h/.hpp) files are a good place to declare things like forward declarations, classes, function stubs, and constants
- header files should then be paired with a matchingly named (.cpp) where the implementations of these are defined (functions particularly)
- this can prevent weird problems including files in multiple other files, circular includes, etc
- it also makes projects much more manageable and clearer

## structs and classes
- way to define custom data types
- its a structure, which encapsulates a bunch of pieces of data and tells the program how to structure them in memory
- structs are intended to just model data (they can have methods, but shouldn't for the most part; their fields default to public), whereas classes model data and functionality (their fields default to private)
- both structs and classes themselves are just the **template** for how to store/organise data, and they need to be instantiated to make use of them (i.e. you define a type of object, and then you make an instance of it which you actually handle)
```
struct <identifier>
{
	<data type> <member 1 identifier> = <default value>;
	<etc>;
}
```
and are instantiated like this:
```
<struct identifier> variable_name;
variable_name.<member 1 identifier> = <etc>;
```
- the size of structs is determined at compile time, as the size of all the members added together (with maybe some padding to arrange them, use `sizeof(<struct identifier, NOT an instance>)`)
- unions are a bit different, they can contain and be declared the same as a struct, but they only take the space of the largest member value, this works by overwriting the contents of the block occupied (i.e. so you can only store one of the union's member properties at a time)
- `typedef <current identifier> <new identifier>` can be used to make an alias for data types, for instance for shortening long, complicated templated types to simpler types (e.g. `typedef std::vector<std::string> str_vec` so now you can just use 'str_vec' as an alias for all that other stuff)
