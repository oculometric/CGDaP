- pointers are a type of variable/data which point to a location in memory, usually where something is stored
- they mean you don't need to copy things back and forward, you can just point to where an object is stored
- this is called **indirect memory access**
- the variable of the pointer holds the **address** of the data in memory, not the data itself
- the pointer itself is also stored in memory somewhere, so you can have a pointer which points to memory address X, and the contents of X is a pointer to another memory address Y
- pointers can be used to access data from outside the current scope, without passing them in as big arguments. instead of passing in an entire copy of an object, you pass in a pointer to where that object already exists in memory
- syntax
`<type>* pointer_to_type;` makes a pointer variable
- `NULL` or `nullptr` values represent a pointer which isnt pointing to anything. i.e. `0x0` or memory address zero
- to get the address of an existing variable: `int* ptr_to_a = &a;`, in this case we get the address of `a`
- to get the value at a pointer (at the address pointed to by the pointer): `int val = *a;`, in this case we get the value stored at the address pointed to by `a`. this is also called **dereferencing**
- we can assign something to a pointer, but we're assigning the **address to which the pointer points** and **not the value at the address**
- we can do pointer arithmetic, where we are multiplying, adding, etc to access memory addresses relative to the original pointer

- the stack is where local variables are allocated. when we call a function, a new stack frame is pushed, containing information about arguments passed to the function and the return address (i.e. where we called it from)
- local variables are allocated here, and deallocated/destroyed when we return, and the stack frame is popped

- the heap is dynamic memory, where we allocate memory manually. this is not garbage collected at all, when things are allocated here, they must be deallocated when they are no longer being used
- can be allocated to whatever size you need, whenever you want
- slightly slower to allocate than the stack

the new keyword allocates memory on the heap. it allocates based on the size of a data type, and potentially the length of an array:
`int* a = new int; // pointer to a new block of memory, which is the size of a single int`
`int* b = new int[32]; // pointer to a new block of memory, which is the size of 32 ints continuously`

we need to use the delete keyword to tell the operating system we've stopped using a block of memory:
`delete a; // deletes a single pointer value`
`delete[] b; // deletes an entire array`

- references are similar to pointers, but they don't need dereferencing
- we declare them as `int& b;`
- they can be treated like pointers (i.e. remotely modifiable), but don't need pointer syntax
- you can pass parameters to a function by reference, and those arguments can be modified (i.e. you could pass a reference to where you want your output to appear instead of returning it, useful if you need multiple return values)

`const int* thing; // the int is const, the pointer is not`
`int* const thing; // the pointer is const, but the value at the address can be changed`

- arrays are really just pointers to blocks of memory
- when you access properties of a pointer to an object, you use `obj->property` instead of `obj.property`
