- a text based game is any program that takes input and gives output purely using the console
- a typical game loop is to handle user input, update the game state, and then output to the console
- its a good idea to keep the game state as a struct containing info about the game state, which can be passed around as a ref/pointer

- the problem with arrays is that they are fixed sized (you can delete and reallocate but that takes time and is complicated)
- the `std::vector` is a list class which encapsulates the ability to append (resize) elements, meaning copying and reallocating as needed
- useful if you don't know how many items you will have
- it is templated with `std::vector<type>` where `type` is replaced with whatever type you want in the array
- has size (number of elements), and capacity (amount of space)
- when appending an element if size = capacity, the array will be reallocated and copied to a new, bigger memory block
- computationally expensive to constantly be copying and reallocating
