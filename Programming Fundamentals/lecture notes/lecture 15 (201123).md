- the STL is the Standard Template Library, provides common templated data structures (e.g. `std::map`, `std::vector`)
- STL is part of `std`, the STanDard library that you always get (unless you're working in freestanding mode, oo scary) 
- sequence containers
	- `std::vector` - resizable array
	- `std::deque` - double ended queue
	- `std::array`- fixed sized array
	- `std::list` - doubly linked list
- when passing data to functions, you will lose the size of an array (`int values[32]` will just become `int* values`), which is called pointer decay, this is one of the reasons for the `std::array`
