- the STL is the Standard Template Library, provides common templated data structures (e.g. `std::map`, `std::vector`)
- STL is part of `std`, the STanDard library that you always get (unless you're working in freestanding mode, oo scary) 
- sequence containers
	- `std::vector` - resizable array
	- `std::deque` - double ended queue
	- `std::array`- fixed sized array
	- `std::list` - doubly linked list
- when passing data to functions, you will lose the size of an array (`int values[32]` will just become `int* values`), which is called pointer decay, this is one of the reasons for the `std::array`. you can solve this jankily by just passing the size of the array as a parameter
- container adaptors
	- `std::stack`
- associative containers
	- `set` - sorted data, unique values
	- `multiset` - sorted data, with duplicates
	- `map` - data which maps sorted keys to values
	- `multimap` - map with non-unique keys
- algorithm header has various functions
	- sort
	- find
	- copy
	- shuffle
	- binary search
	- min
	- max
	- minmax

- properties marked as `static` have the same value across all instances of a class
- when applied to a variable inside a function, it **should not be dealocated between returning and calling the function again**
- static properties can be set outside the class with something like `int ClassName::static_property = 10;` which will set the value for all instances of `ClassName`


**follow the ISO C++ core guidelines if you want best-practice code**
