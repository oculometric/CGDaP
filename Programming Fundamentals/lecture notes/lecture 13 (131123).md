- overloading allows us to define multiple versions of a function with the same identifier, but with different parameters and/or return types
- e.g. `int add(int, int)`, `float add(float, float, float)`, etc
- useful for having optional parameters
- you cannot overload a function only on its return type
- constructors can also be overloaded (they are just functions after all)
- you can provide default value for arguments (making them optional) like this:
`int do_thing(int a, int b = 5); // a is required, but b will default to 5 if not provided`  
- functions can be templated, with a stand-in (usually T) replacing the type
- `vector<float>` is an example, where a vector takes a templated type (and the type is float)
- for functions:
```
template <typename T>
T sum(T a, T b)
{
	return a + b;
}
```
- functions can be called with explicit types `sum<int>(...)` or implicitly `sum(5, 3)`
- you can template classes in the same way by putting the `template <typename T>` before the class declaration
- want to constrain your type? use concepts! (he moved the slide too quickly i couldnt write it down in time)
- you can overload operators like this:
`int operator+(int a, int b);`
- you can do this for any basic operator in c++
