- classes are similar to structs, but they can have more logic and functions attached
- objects are instances of classes, classes are blueprints for the objects for what data they contain and how they are stored, and what methods they implement
- members in a class are private by default, whereas struct members are public by default
- makes code much easier to understand conceptually
- behaviour can be encapsulated
- public members are accessible from outside the class, private can only be accessed from inside the class. protected members are similar to private but can be accessed inside inherited classes
- we can use the `friend` keyword to allow one class to access the private members of another class
- constructors construct a class, they don't have a return type (because their return type is just the class). basically a function called when the class is instantiated
- destructors destroy a class as part of/before deallocation. allows you to clean up the instance for instance allowing you to deallocate heap allocated memory, close files, same as the constructor but with a `~` before the name
```
int a(5); // direct init
int b{5}; // value
int c = 5; // copy

int d[]{5,2,3}; // list init
int e[] = {5,2,3}; // aggregate init
```
