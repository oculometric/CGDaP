- loops may be deterministic (the number of times the loop will run is determined beforehand) or non-deterministic (loop that will keep running until some condition is met which the program doesn't know)
- classic C++ for loop `for(<init counter>; <condition on counter>; <increment counter>) { }`
- foreach/ranger for loops look like this `for(<type> <identifier> : <iterable>) { }`  where identifier will be given each element in the iterable on each iteration of the loop (i.e. stepping through an array)
- while loops are non-deterministic `while (<condition>) { }`
- do while loops are like while loops, but will always perform the loop code at least once `do { } while (<condition>);`
- infinite loops are things that shouldn't usually exist, there should always be an exit condition of some form
- you can nest loops (just like you can nest most kinds of code blocks)
- loops can be escaped with `break`, or you can skip to the next iteration of the loop with the `continue` keyword
