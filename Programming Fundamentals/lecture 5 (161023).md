- functions, aka subroutines, aka methods are used to break code into smaller blocks
- can be used to encapsulate functionality so that other parts of a program can use that bit of functionality without worrying about how it's actually implemented
- allows **decoupling** (so code doesn't depend heavily on other parts of itself)
- useful for code that is reused
- functions must be declared, including their return type, identifier, and parameters, and must also be implemented somewhere (usually where they are declared, but not always)
- functions can return data as well as taking it in via arguments
- formal parameters are those specified in the function declaration, actual parameters are those actually provided when the function is called
- when a function is called/invoked, control flow jumps to the start of the function, and when we reach a `return` statement or the end of the function, control flow returns (jumps back) to were execution left off
- functions can help readability and maintainability, reduce the amount of code overall (e.g. for repeated blocks of code)
- they're also a conceptual tool for breaking down a problem (decomposition) into smaller, easier to solve problems
- functions allow you to split things into modules, compartmentalise, and can be useful for splitting up work between people working on a project
- functions should be independent from one another and the specific implementation of a function
- code can be split up into a logical structure
- aaaaand they look like this:
```
<return type> <identifier> (<parameter type> <parameter name>, ...)
{
	<function body>
}
```
- we can return `void` if we don't want to return anything
- functions are called like this:
```
<function name>(<arguments>);
// or, if it returns
<variable name> = <function name>(<arguments>);
// or, if no args
<function name>();
```
- explicitly speaking, a function always returns some data, a procedure does not, and a method is a function that is part of a class
- functions only ever return one item
- if a function declaration says it returns data, all code paths in the function must return a value of that type
- forward declarations are useful since we may want to implement a function _after_ it gets used (for instance if we have two functions which call one another). we declare a stub, without the actual function body, and we implement the function (i.e. providing the actual code for it) later in the program
