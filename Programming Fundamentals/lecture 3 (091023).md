- conditionals allow the program to branch and choose which code to execute base on a condition
- for example, `if...else` statements `switch...case` and even ternary operator
- `if...else if...else` style chained statements are mutually exclusive: i.e. only the first condition which is met will be executed, then execution will jump to the end of the statement
- a condition is (usually) represented by a boolean expression: this can be a bool variable, the result of an operator such as `==` `<=` `<` `>` `>=` `!=` 
- boolean expressions can be chained and manipulated with `&&` (and), `||` (or), `!`(not)
- `switch...case` statements are NOT mutually exclusive. each condition, or `case` within a `switch` will fall through into the next case if executed, so you need a `break` statement to break out of the statement when you want to
- can be useful, especially with enums, more readable with lots of cases based on the same variable
