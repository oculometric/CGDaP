souls-likes come from Demon SOULS and Dark SOULS with the resurgence of 'difficult games'. key traits are respawning enemies, stamina, a steep difficulty curve, losing currency on death, a focus on timing and rhythm when fighting.
setting typically is dark-fantasy, often with metaphorical themes. another key feature is non-linear level design and progression-locking regions behind abilities.
 often feature a single continuous world.
 often secrets will be hidden with no real goal of them being found.

some games feature difficulty controls, these can be good but can also make the experience inconsistent.

another key point is that world of the game is built with deep lore that cements that the world exists without/before the player.

Tunic is a souls-like game where the story has already happened, chests are opened already, and languages are foreign. nothing is explained unless you go looking, and there's no goal other than exploring. the world is full of loops and shortcuts.

GENRE-like games aren't necessarily the best, they're just an archetype of the style which happened to appear at the right time. useful as a communication tool. can downplay follow-ups or box things in too much, so be careful with that.
