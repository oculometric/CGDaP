opengl 1.x uses a right handed coordinate system:
- +X axis is right
- +Y axis is up visually
- +Z axis is into the camera

normals are normalised (length 1) vectors perpendicular to faces.

triangles are versatile primitives which are the simplest primitive for which a normal vector can be generated such that the face is guaranteed to be planar.

data duplication is minimised using two lists: a list of vertices (points) and a list of triangle corners (sets of 3 integers which index into the vertex array). i.e. 'which vertices should i use to construct this triangle'.

winding order of vertices matters. this is used to determine which side of a triangle is the front/back. the normal points out of the front of the face.
opengl 1.x uses counter-clockwise winding, meaning that vertices are specified counter-clockwise when looking at the front of a face.

the z-buffer or depth buffer keeps track of how far away pixels are from the camera. each time a triangle is rendered, it is tested against the z-buffer. if the depth at that point is greater than the current (previously rendered) depth for that pixel, then the pixel is not overwritten.

to initialise the depth buffer
```
glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGB | GLUT_DEPTH);
glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);
glDepthFunc(GL_LESS);
```
