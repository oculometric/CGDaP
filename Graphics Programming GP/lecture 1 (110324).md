opengl yeaaa babyyyy

GLUT - Graphics Library Utilities Toolkit

ohhhh boy when the lecturer says its hard you kjnow its gonn abe good

fuck we have to use visula studio again :(

FreeGLUT for window creation

OpenGL is an abstraction layer between hardware and 3D game development. it's a cross-platform API providing a universal interface which 3D applications can talk to without writing hardware specific code. we're using GL1.x
DirectX is an alternative except its Windows exclusive because of course it fucking is. Vulkan is another alternative.

no shaders. huh

we're writing in c++.

opengl's screen space coordinates exist in the space (-1,-1) bottom left to (1,1) top right.

opengl is a state machine. we set it in a state (e.g. with a colour, with a texture, etc), and then draw objects in this state.

`glVertex2f(x, y)` - place a vertex within a polygon at a position in NDC.
`glColor3f(r,g,b)` - set color
`glBegin(GL_POLYGON)` - start drawing an object, in polygon mode
`glPolygonMode( GL_FRONT_AND_BACK, GL_LINE )` - draw mesh as lines, front and back, alternatively with `GL_FILL`, draw it with actual filled faces

the **assignment**: load and render multiple objects, animate/move those objects, complex objects loaded from a suitable file, texturing, materials, lighting, scene graph. some kind of 3D demo using these techniques.
