binary trees are a way of storing data and their hierarchical structure allows you to build a scene hierarchy with it.

nodes in a b-tree consist of a data part, a left pointer (to another node) and a right pointer. each node has a single parent and up to two children.

can be easily traversed with recursion.

maybe revise postorder, preorder, inorder traversals, depth-first, breadth-first.

can also be used for searching algorithms very efficiently.

trees are more effective to traverse if they're balanced, minimising average depth.
